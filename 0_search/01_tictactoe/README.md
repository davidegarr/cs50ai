# Problem Set 01: Tictactoe

This project involves the implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent. The game is divided into two main files:

1. "runner.py": Handles the graphical interface for the game. This file is already provided and should be used to execute the game.
2. "tictactoe.py": Contains the core logic of the game, including the AI's decision-making process.
