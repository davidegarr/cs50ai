# Problem Set 00: Degrees
The goal is to find the shortest connection between two actors via movies the have starred in. If "Actor A" starred in movie with "Actor B", and "Actor B" starred in another movie with "Actor C", then "Actor A" has a two-degree connection with "Actor C".

The program uses a Breadth-Frist Search (BFS) algorithm to solve the problem.
