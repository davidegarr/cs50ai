# Analysis

## Layer 6, Head 7

Layer 6 Head 7 seems to be focusing on the understanding on Transistive Phrasal Verbs. For the two sentences bewlow, the resulting diagram is quite clean, and the full attention seems to be focused in the relationship (put) <--> (up with) and (came) <--> (up with).

Example Sentences:
- Charlie couldn't put up with the [MASK] cats any longer.
- He came up with a clever new idea about [MASK].

## Layer 2, Head 5

Ayer 2 Head 5 seems to be focusing on the previous word. Altough a bit noisy, the attention diagram clearly shows this pattern.

Example Sentences:
- [MASK] chemistry is the hardest course in university.
- He said that he would come at [MASK].
