# Problem Set 21: Heredity

The objective is to model the genetic traits that might be passed down from generation to generation based on available data. Three functions needed implementation:

1. "joint_probability": Calculates a joint probability given a particular set of gene counts.
2. "update": Adds the joint probability to the existing ones.
3. "normalize": Normalizes the resulting probabilities to ensure they sum to 1.
