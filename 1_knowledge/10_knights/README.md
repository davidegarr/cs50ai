# Problem Set 10: Knights

This project explores the realm of propositional logic through the Knights and Knaves puzzles.

The project is structured into two main files:

1. "logic.py": This file is provided. It provides the foundational classes and functions for various logical connectives and operations.
2. "pyzzle.py": Using propositional symbols like AKnight or AKnave, it represents statements like "A is a knight" or "A is a knave". The challenge is to fill in various knowledge bases to solve distinct Knights and Knaves puzzles.

The objective is to represent the Knights and Knaves puzzles in a way that an AI model-checking algorithm can determine the truth value of the statements and solve the puzzle.
