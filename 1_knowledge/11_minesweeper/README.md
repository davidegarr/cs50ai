# Problem Set 11: Minesweeper

The project goes through the logical reasoningof designing an AI to play Minesweeper.

There are two primary files:

1. "minesweeper.py": This file is the heart of the Minesweeper game and its AI player. It contains classes responsible for the game mechanics, representation of logical statements about the game state, and the AI's decision-making capabilities. The objective is to effectively play Minesweeper using informed logical inferences.

2. "runner.py": This file is provided. It offers the game's graphical interface and allows for either manual or AI-driven gameplay.
